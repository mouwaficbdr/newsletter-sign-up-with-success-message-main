## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned about checkValidity() method. Useful to check default required conditions of the html.

```js
if (email.checkValidity()) {
  registeredMail = email.value;
  document.getElementById('mail').textContent = registeredMail;
  document.querySelector('.signup').classList.add('hidden');
  document.querySelector('.success').classList.remove('hidden');
}
```

### Continued development

Write less CSS and optimize my media queries.
